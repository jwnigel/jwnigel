### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, my name is Nigel and I am a python programmer and data scientist. I have a four-year-old daughter and split my time between the US and Mexico.

- ðŸ”­ I am currently working to start a 22-acre farm and nursery and am using programming to help: in my website design, and in data analysis of my area's historical weather trends to optimize planting.
- ðŸŒ± Learning via Le Wagon bootcamp, books, and udemy.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on anything! I would love to do more weather/climate related data science, agriculture or sports related (I am a huge Cleveland Browns fan).
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about anything! I know a bit about growing trees and permaculture/agriculture, and am learning how to use python for data science. 
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: nigeljwright22@gmail.com
- âš¡ Fun fact: I have taught English in Africa for a year, and have been in Mexico for 5+ years.
