### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, my name is Nigel and I am a python programmer, learning on my own through books online courses. I am have a three-year-old daughter and split my time between the US and Mexico.

- ðŸ”­ I am currently working to start a 22-acre farm and nursery and am using python where I can: in my website design, and in data analysis of my area's weather over the past 40+ years. 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning via several books and two udemy courses.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on anything! I would love to do more weather/climate related data science, agriculture or sports related (I am a huge Cleveland Browns fan), web design, app creation, or anything else!
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about anything! I know a bit about growing trees and permaculture/agriculture, and am learning how to use python for data science.
